#Overview
  Expanded, find image D-Allose (D-Allose) is a rare monosaccharide that occurs rarely in the natural environment.D-Allose is 80% sweeter relative to table sugar but is extremely low in calories and non-toxic, making it ideal for replacing table sugar in foods.D-Allose is a low-calorie, rare sugar that has sweetness properties similar to those of sucrose but accounts for just D-allulose is a low-calorie rare sugar with similar sweetness properties to sucrose, but accounts for only 38% of sucrose's energy.D-allulose has anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, anti-osteoporosis, neuroprotective, cryoprotective, and immunosuppressive properties, which make it a promising candidate for applications in food systems, clinical therapeutics, and healthcare.
    
  Genetically encoded whole-cell biosensors are capable of sensing changes in metabolite concentrations inside and outside the cell as well as fluctuations in the external environment to produce measurable signal outputs or gene expression levels in regulatory pathways. In this study, we designed a genetically encoded biosensor based on D-allulose-regulated genes for real-time monitoring of D-allulose concentration to provide an effective high-throughput screening tool for the targeted evolution of D-allulose-related synthases.
